<p class="p1"># Redis configuration file example.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be</p>
<p class="p1"># started with the file path as first argument:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify</p>
<p class="p1"># it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1k =&gt; 1000 bytes</p>
<p class="p1"># 1kb =&gt; 1024 bytes</p>
<p class="p1"># 1m =&gt; 1000000 bytes</p>
<p class="p1"># 1mb =&gt; 1024*1024 bytes</p>
<p class="p1"># 1g =&gt; 1000000000 bytes</p>
<p class="p1"># 1gb =&gt; 1024*1024*1024 bytes</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.</p>

<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration</p>

<p class="p1"># By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens</p>
<p class="p1"># for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.</p>
<p class="p1"># It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using</p>
<p class="p1"># the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Examples:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1</p>
<p class="p1"># bind 127.0.0.1 ::1</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the</p>
<p class="p1"># internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the</p>
<p class="p1"># instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the</p>
<p class="p1"># following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into</p>
<p class="p1"># the IPv4 lookback interface address (this means Redis will be able to</p>
<p class="p1"># accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it</p>
<p class="p1"># is running).</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES</p>
<p class="p1"># JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.</p>
<p class="p1"># ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p class="p1">bind 127.0.0.1</p>

<p class="p1"># Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that</p>
<p class="p1"># Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># When protected mode is on and if:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"bind" directive.</p>
<p class="p1"># 2) No password is configured.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the</p>

<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if</p>
<p class="p1"># you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis</p>

<p class="p1">loglevel notice</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force</p>

<p class="p1">logfile "redis_6381.log"</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># To enable logging to the system logger, just set 'syslog-enabled' to yes,</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of</p>
<p class="p1"># another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>a given number of slaves.</p>
<p class="p1"># 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.</p>
<p class="p1"># 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>and resynchronize with them.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># slaveof &lt;masterip&gt; &lt;masterport&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration</p>
<p class="p1"># directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before</p>
<p class="p1"># starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will</p>
<p class="p1"># refuse the slave request.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># masterauth &lt;master-password&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication</p>
<p class="p1"># is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>but to INFO and SLAVEOF.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1">slave-serve-stale-data yes</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against</p>
<p class="p1"># a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data</p>
<p class="p1"># written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but</p>
<p class="p1"># may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a</p>
<p class="p1"># misconfiguration.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients</p>
<p class="p1"># on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.</p>
<p class="p1"># Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands</p>
<p class="p1"># such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve</p>
<p class="p1"># security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the</p>
<p class="p1"># administrative / dangerous commands.</p>
<p class="p1">slave-read-only yes</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.</p>

<p class="p1"># -------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p1"># WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY</p>
<p class="p1"># -------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication</p>
<p class="p1"># process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full</p>
<p class="p1"># synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.</p>
<p class="p1"># The transmission can happen in two different ways:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB</p>
<p class="p1"># <span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent</p>
<p class="p1"># <span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>process to the slaves incrementally.</p>
<p class="p1"># 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves</p>
<p class="p1"># can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing</p>
<p class="p1"># the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once</p>
<p class="p1"># the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer</p>
<p class="p1"># will start when the current one terminates.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of</p>
<p class="p1"># time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves</p>
<p class="p1"># will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication</p>
<p class="p1"># works better.</p>
<p class="p1">repl-diskless-sync no</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay</p>
<p class="p1"># the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket</p>
<p class="p1"># to the slaves.</p>

<p class="p1">############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"># Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking</p>
<p class="p1"># deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands</p>
<p class="p1"># in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous</p>
<p class="p1"># way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed</p>
<p class="p1"># in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other</p>
<p class="p1"># O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an</p>
<p class="p1"># aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for</p>
<p class="p1"># a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives</p>
<p class="p1"># such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and</p>
<p class="p1"># FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands</p>
<p class="p1"># are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the</p>
<p class="p1"># object in the background as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.</p>
<p class="p1"># It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good</p>
<p class="p1"># idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to</p>
<p class="p1"># delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.</p>
<p class="p1"># Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the</p>
<p class="p1"># following scenarios:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>memory limit.</p>
<p class="p1"># 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.</p>
<p class="p1"># 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>it with the specified string.</p>
<p class="p1"># 4) During replication, when a slave performs a full resynchronization with</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>load the RDB file just transfered.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,</p>
<p class="p1"># like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically</p>
<p class="p1"># in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK</p>
<p class="p1"># was called, using the following configuration directives:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">lazyfree-lazy-eviction no</p>
<p class="p1">lazyfree-lazy-expire no</p>
<p class="p1">lazyfree-lazy-server-del no</p>

<p class="p1"># By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is</p>
<p class="p1"># good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or</p>
<p class="p1"># a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on</p>
<p class="p1"># the configured save points).</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides</p>
<p class="p1"># much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy</p>
<p class="p1"># (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a</p>
<p class="p1"># dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something</p>
<p class="p1"># wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is</p>
<p class="p1"># still running correctly.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.</p>
<p class="p1"># If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file</p>
<p class="p1"># with the better durability guarantees.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>

<p class="p1"># The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk</p>
<p class="p1"># instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush</p>
<p class="p1"># data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Redis supports three different modes:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.</p>
<p class="p1"># always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.</p>
<p class="p1"># everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between</p>
<p class="p1"># speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to</p>
<p class="p1"># "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when</p>
<p class="p1"># it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of</p>
<p class="p1"># some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),</p>
<p class="p1"># or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than</p>
<p class="p1"># everysec.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># More details please check the following article:</p>
<p class="p1"># http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html</p>

<p class="p1"># When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background</p>
<p class="p1"># saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is</p>
<p class="p1"># performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations</p>
<p class="p1"># Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for</p>
<p class="p1"># this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block</p>
<p class="p1"># our synchronous write(2) call.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option</p>
<p class="p1"># that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a</p>
<p class="p1"># BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is</p>
<p class="p1"># the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is</p>

<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>replication offset (more data from the master processed).</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the</p>

<p class="p1"># is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the</p>
<p class="p1"># slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master</p>
<p class="p1"># for longer than 310 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>

<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static</p>
<p class="p1"># configuration where each node knows its public address is needed. The</p>
<p class="p1"># following two options are used for this scope, and are:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>

<p class="p1"># * cluster-announce-bus-port</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Each instruct the node about its address, client port, and cluster message</p>
<p class="p1"># bus port. The information is then published in the header of the bus packets</p>
<p class="p1"># so that other nodes will be able to correctly map the address of the node</p>
<p class="p1"># publishing the information.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection</p>

<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of</p>
<p class="p1"># clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending</p>
<p class="p1"># on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of</p>
<p class="p1"># 10000 will be used as usually.</p>

<p class="p1"># The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients</p>

<p class="p1"># common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the</p>
<p class="p1"># publisher can produce them).</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:</p>

<p class="p1"># the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of</p>
<p class="p1"># seconds (continuously).</p>
<p class="p1"># So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is</p>
<p class="p1"># 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately</p>
<p class="p1"># if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get</p>
<p class="p1"># disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes</p>
<p class="p1"># the limit for 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data</p>
<p class="p1"># without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only</p>
<p class="p1"># asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster</p>
<p class="p1"># than it can read.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since</p>

<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it's maximum value is 255, so Redis</p>
<p class="p1"># uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value</p>

<p class="p1"># this way:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.</p>
<p class="p1"># 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).</p>
<p class="p1"># 3. The counter is incremented only if R &lt; P.</p>

<p class="p1">########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># WARNING THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL. However it was stress tested</p>
<p class="p1"># even in production and manually tested by multiple engineers for some</p>
<p class="p1"># time.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># What is active defragmentation?</p>
<p class="p1"># -------------------------------</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the</p>
<p class="p1"># spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,</p>
<p class="p1"># thus allowing to reclaim back memory.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but</p>
<p class="p1"># less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server</p>
<p class="p1"># restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush</p>
<p class="p1"># away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature</p>
<p class="p1"># implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime</p>
<p class="p1"># in an "hot" way, while the server is running.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the</p>
<p class="p1"># configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the</p>
<p class="p1"># values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc</p>
<p class="p1"># features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation</p>
<p class="p1"># and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the</p>
<p class="p1"># old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys</p>
<p class="p1"># will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># Important things to understand:</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This is the default with Linux builds.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don't have fragmentation</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>issues.</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when</p>
<p class="p1">#<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>needed with the command "CONFIG SET activedefrag yes".</p>
<p class="p1">#</p>
<p class="p1"># The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the</p>
<p class="p1"># defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is</p>
<p class="p1"># a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.</p>
